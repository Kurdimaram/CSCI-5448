# CSCI-5448
Maram Kurdi
For the Graduate Presentation I wrote my code on Jupyter notebooks (ipython) so that it will be more organized. 
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
The code will ask the user to enter a text in order to preprocess it for nay NLP tasks
Text preprocessing include:
Sentence Tokenization
Word Tokenization
Removing Stopwords
Removing Punctuation
Stemming
Lemmatization
Part of Speech Tagging
Frequency Distribution
Chunking
Sentiment Analysis

- I have included the presentation_code.html , presentation_code.ipynb , presentation_code.py
