# CSCI-5448 - Graduate Presentation
- Maram Kurdi
For the graduate presentation I wrote my code on Jupyter notebooks (ipython) so that it will be more organized. 
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- The code will ask the user to enter a text in order to preprocess it for nay NLP tasks
- Text preprocessing include:
Sentence Tokenization, Word Tokenization , Removing Stopwords, Removing Punctuation, Stemming, Lemmatization, Part of Speech Tagging, Frequency Distribution, Chunking, and Sentiment Analysis

- I have included the presentation_code.html , presentation_code.ipynb , and presentation_code.py
